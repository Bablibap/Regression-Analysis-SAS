# Generating Donations for NGO
A non-profit-organization with a million members is working on a fundraising campaign. This document proposes an uplift marketing model that can be used to build and aid direct contact campaign for the following year.
# What is the problem?
One of the biggest challenges NGOs must face regularly, is their ability to secure enough funds for their continued existence. NGOs are reliant on not only the number of donations but also the amount of donations made by their members. To serve this purpose, NGOs organize fund raising events. The main aim of these campaigns is to contact as many “persuadable” members as possible to generate the highest amount of donations. However, there is a cost associated with every person who is contacted. The ultimate business goal is to increase campaign response, increase return on investment, and increase overall market rate. The target population of interest are the members of the NGO. A small sample of 1,000,000 members were selected to build and train the uplift marketing model.
# What was built?
A two step uplift marketing model was built. There are two components to the model:
1. Predict the probability that a member of the NGO will donate. (A logistic regression model was built)
2. Of the members with high probability of donating to the NGO, predict the amount of money they will donate. (A regression model was built)
# Results
Through this two step modelling, the NGO was predicted to make an operating surplus of $11,872,890 by targetting only 172,097 of the 1 million people. Therefore, by targetting the right people, the total donation received for the year increased by approximately 57%.
